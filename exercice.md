Tasks

1. Implement a data structure for representing complex numbers using C structures. Create the following methods:

Setter methods

setRealPart() which sets the real part of the complex number (setter method)

setImaginaryPart() which sets the imaginary part of the complex number

Getter methods

getRealPart() which retrieves the real part

getImaginaryPart() which retrieves the complex part

Operations

Add()

Sub()

Multiply()

Divide()


2.  Create an array of complex numbers to just make a list of many complex numbers.

Insert a new complex number at a given index, insert(complex number, int index) // shifts elements (elements are complex numbers)

Delete a complex number from any part of the array, delete(int index) //shifts elements  (elements are complex numbers)


3. Apply the operations in (1) to the list created in (2)

Add()/Sub()/Multiply()/Divide() consecutively adds/subtracts/multiplies/divides the complex numbers stored in the list.
